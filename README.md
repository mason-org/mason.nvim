# Introduction

`mason.nvim` is a Neovim plugin that allow you to easily manage external editor tooling such as LSP servers, DAP servers,
linters, and formatters through a single interface. It runs everywhere Neovim runs (across Linux, macOS, Windows, etc.),
with only a small set of [external requirements](#requirements) needed.

Packages are installed to Neovim's `:h stdpath` by default. Executables are linked to a single `bin/` directory, which
`mason.nvim` will add to Neovim's PATH during setup, allowing seamless access from Neovim builtins (shell, terminal,
etc.) as well as other 3rd party plugins.

# Requirements

`mason.nvim` relaxes the minimum requirements by attempting multiple different utilities (for example, `wget`,
`curl`, and `Invoke-WebRequest` are all perfect substitutes).
The _minimum_ recommended requirements are:

-   neovim `>= 0.7.0`
-   For Unix systems: `git(1)`, `curl(1)` or `wget(1)`, `unzip(1)`, `tar(1)`, `gzip(1)`
-   For Windows systems: powershell, git, tar, and [7zip][7zip] or [peazip][peazip] or [archiver][archiver] or [winzip][winzip] or [WinRAR][winrar]

Note that `mason.nvim` will regularly shell out to external package managers, such as `cargo` and `npm`. Depending on
your personal usage, some of these will also need to be installed. Refer to `:checkhealth mason` for a full list.

# Configuration

You may optionally configure certain behavior of `mason.nvim` when calling the `.setup()` function. Refer to the
[default configuration](#default-configuration) for a list of all available settings.

Example:

```lua
require("mason").setup({
    ui = {
        icons = {
            package_installed = "✓",
            package_pending = "➜",
            package_uninstalled = "✗"
        }
    }
})
```

## Default configuration

```lua
local DEFAULT_SETTINGS = {
    ui = {
        -- The border to use for the UI window. Accepts same border values as |nvim_open_win()|.
        border = "none",

        icons = {
            -- The list icon to use for installed packages.
            package_installed = "◍",
            -- The list icon to use for packages that are installing, or queued for installation.
            package_pending = "◍",
            -- The list icon to use for packages that are not installed.
            package_uninstalled = "◍",
        },

        keymaps = {
            -- Keymap to expand a package
            toggle_package_expand = "<CR>",
            -- Keymap to install the package under the current cursor position
            install_package = "i",
            -- Keymap to reinstall/update the package under the current cursor position
            update_package = "u",
            -- Keymap to check for new version for the package under the current cursor position
            check_package_version = "c",
            -- Keymap to update all installed packages
            update_all_packages = "U",
            -- Keymap to check which installed packages are outdated
            check_outdated_packages = "C",
            -- Keymap to uninstall a package
            uninstall_package = "X",
            -- Keymap to cancel a package installation
            cancel_installation = "<C-c>",
            -- Keymap to apply language filter
            apply_language_filter = "<C-f>",
        },
    },

    -- The directory in which to install packages.
    install_root_dir = path.concat { vim.fn.stdpath "data", "mason" },

    pip = {
        -- These args will be added to `pip install` calls. Note that setting extra args might impact intended behavior
        -- and is not recommended.
        --
        -- Example: { "--proxy", "https://proxyserver" }
        install_args = {},
    },

    -- Controls to which degree logs are written to the log file. It's useful to set this to vim.log.levels.DEBUG when
    -- debugging issues with package installations.
    log_level = vim.log.levels.INFO,

    -- Limit for the maximum amount of packages to be installed at the same time. Once this limit is reached, any further
    -- packages that are requested to be installed will be put in a queue.
    max_concurrent_installers = 4,

    github = {
        -- The template URL to use when downloading assets from GitHub.
        -- The placeholders are the following (in order):
        -- 1. The repository (e.g. "rust-lang/rust-analyzer")
        -- 2. The release version (e.g. "v0.3.0")
        -- 3. The asset name (e.g. "rust-analyzer-v0.3.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz")

# Extensions

## `mason-lspconfig`

`mason-lspconfig` is a extension that ships with `mason.nvim`. It bridges `mason.nvim` with the
[`lspconfig`](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) plugin in order to make it easier to use the both plugins
together.

It is recommended to use this extension if you use `lspconfig`. To use this extension, make sure to set it up after
`mason.nvim`, like so:

```lua
require("mason").setup()
require("mason-lspconfig").setup()
```

For more documentation, see [`:h mason-lspconfig`](./doc/mason-lspconfig.txt).
